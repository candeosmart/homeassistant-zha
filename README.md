ZHA Quirks for Candeo Zigbee Devices

Support for Candeo Zigbee Devices for the most part is built in to ZHA already, simply check https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers/tree/dev/zhaquirks/candeo for your device and ensure that you are running the latest version of ZHA.

ZHA Quirks found here are typically pre-release versions that fix a known problem or add functionality.  Generally it should not be necessary to use these unless specifically instructed to by Candeo Support.
